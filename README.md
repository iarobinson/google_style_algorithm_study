How I Would Prepare for an Interview as a Front End Developer at Google

# Broad Algorithms and Concepts

- [ ] [sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)


- [ ] [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm)


- [ ] [divide and compare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm)


- [ ] [dynamic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) / [memoization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization)

Here is a good description of how to thinki of the [choice between memoization and dynamicprogramming](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6184869/what-is-the-difference-between-memoization-and-dynamic-programming)


- [ ] [greediness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)


- [ ] [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))

  "In order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion" - Unknown

  Recursion is best visualized when you hold a mirror up to another mirror in just the perfect angle so that you can see what infinity looks like. One mirror reflects another mirror forever.

  But when writing software, we can create a base case and use recursion to evaluate complex data structures without us needing to think of every edge case explicitly.

  If you wanted to write a simple recursive function that counted down from a chosen number to one, [here is an example](/codeExamples/recursiveCountDown.js).


- [ ] [Big-o-notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)

  Simply put, Big-0 notation is a way to calculate the runtime of an algorithm in a _back of the envelope_ sort of way. It's not rigorous mathematical perfection... but it will give you a fairly good idea for how fast your program will work when it encounters a huge data set.
