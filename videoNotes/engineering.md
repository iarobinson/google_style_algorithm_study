## How to: Prepare for a Google Engineering Interview

In [this video](https://youtu.be/ko-KkSmp-Lk) the list of the things they ask us to be aware of are:

prove what is on your resume
data structures
  hash tables
  stacks [] << push
  array
algorithms
  space complexity (how to improve or change)
  time complexity (how to improve or change)
Be prepared to code on a whiteboard
system design
object oriented design

providing efficient code in a short time frame is key

design question - work with interviewer to create a high level system

general analysis - show you understand all aspects of problem and offer multiple solutions. The interviewer needs to feel they would be willing to work with you on it

API
Object Oriented Design
Test Your Code
Corner Cases for yours and other people's code

Dykstras
A*

hands on testing experience
  how would you unit test this
  interesting test cases
  design end to end integration
  load and performance
  security test

datastructures
  be aware of np complete problems like
     traveling salesman and the napsack
   what np complete actually means
   trees
   tree constructions
   traversal and manipulation algorithms
   hash tables
   stacks
   arrays
   linked lists

 math
  basic descreet math problems
  counting
  probability
  combinatorics
  n-choose-k problems

recursion
  when is recursion more elegant

operating systems
  processcies
  threads
  concurrency issues and everything related
    semaphors
    utextes?
    locks
  resource allocation
    what resources a process or thread might need
  context switching
    know it's initiated in the operating system and underlying hardware
  scheduling

system design
  knowledge theory and judgement for real world problems
  feature sets
  interfaces
  class hierarchies
  distributed systems
  designing a system under certain constrains

how the internet actually works and the pieces that make it up
  routers
  domain name servers
  load balancers
  firewalls

basics of how search works

Three Final Tips to be Successful at Interviews

1) Explain and Clarify - Talk through it.
  Clarifying the question. They will be intentionally vague.
2) Keep thinking - It's strenous so keep thinking through the problem
3) Practice physically writing code
  find problems
  write code
  solve them
